// You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.

// Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.

// Example 1:
// Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
// Output: 5
// Explanation: 

// -1+1+1+1+1 = 3
// +1-1+1+1+1 = 3
// +1+1-1+1+1 = 3
// +1+1+1-1+1 = 3
// +1+1+1+1-1 = 3

// There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.

// Note:
// The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
// The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
// Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.

// SWITCHING BETWEEN SOLUTIONS:

  // instantiate a memo whose keys will be all possible totals you can reach as you iterate through the nums array. for each number in the array,
  // you will then look at all existing 'origin key'/value pairs, and increment the origin key by num, and also decrement the origin key by num -
  // in both cases the key at that new number should have its value increased by the value of the origin key. (the reason why this work needs to be
  // done in a separate memo is to avoid cross-contamination between old and new data which can result in double counting.) for the first num in
  // the nums array, the memo should have a key for +num and -num, with both values at 1 (or if num is 0 then it should have a key for 0 and a value
  // of 2). for all subsequent nums, make a new temporary memo to document all of the new reachable totals. then, reassign memo to newTotals. note
  // that some of the formerly reachable totals may no longer be reachable! in the end, return the value saved in the memo at key S (the target sum).

  // this is very similar to above. imagine that the problem did not require +/- for each num, but simply required that each num is either "in"
  // (added to the total) or "out" (not added). algebra shows that the solution at key (total + S)/2 to this problem is identical to the solution
  // at key S of the original problem. here, just like above, the memo is instantiated with memo[0] === 1 (if firstNum is "out") and
  // memo[firstNum] === 1 (if firstNum is "in") (unless firstNum is 0, in which case memo[0] === 2, because the total is 0 whether firstNum is "in"
  // or "out"). for all subsequent nums, the new temporary memo, 'changes', stores all possible new totals ONLY IF THAT num IS "in", BECAUSE IF IT
  // IS "out" THEN THE OLD TOTALS DO NOT NEED TO CHANGE! if the new num is "in" then we grab the value at the "origin key", add num to the
  // "origin key", and increment by the "origin value". just like before, this work must be handled separately to avoid cross-contamination between
  // old and new data. then, rather than having the 'changes' memo replace the old memo, we simply add the new values in 'changes' to the original
  // memo (and no reassignment is necessary).

  // NOTE THAT THIS APPEARS TO RUN FASTER THAN THE SOLUTION ABOVE - PROBABLY BECAUSE LESS WORK IS BEING DONE FOR EACH num!
