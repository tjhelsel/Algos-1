// This problem was asked by Google.

// On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.

// You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as (2, 1).

// For example, given M = 5 and the list of bishops:

//   (0, 0)
//   (1, 2)
//   (2, 2)
//   (4, 0)

// The board would look like this:

// [b 0 0 0 0]
// [0 0 b 0 0]
// [0 0 b 0 0]
// [0 0 0 0 0]
// [b 0 0 0 0]

// You should return 2, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops 3 and 4.

// SWITCHING BETWEEN SOLUTIONS:

  // diagonal, use formula k(k - 1)/2 for k bishops on the same diagonal. note the use of a matrix that takes up O(boardSize^2) space.
