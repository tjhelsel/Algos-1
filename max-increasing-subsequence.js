// Given a non-empty array of integers, write a function that returns an array of length 2. The first element in the output array should be an
// integer value representing the greatest sum that can be generated from a strictly-increasing subsequence in the array. The second element
// should be an array of the numbers in that subsequence. A subsequence is defined as a set of numbers that are not necessarily adjacent but
// that are in the same order as they appear in the array. Assume that there will be only be one increasing subsequence with the greatest sum.

// SWITCHING BETWEEN SOLUTIONS:
const maxSumIncreasingSubsequence = solution_2;

  // SOLUTION 1 [O(2^n) time, O(2^n) space]:
  // as you iterate through nums in the array, find all subsequences that could possibly end with num. thus you need to handle 2 possibilities: (1) num stands alone, or (2) num is tacked on
  // to the end of an existing subsequence. for (1), update highestSoFar if num breaks the record, and in every case, add subsequence [num] to the key of num if no subsequence already exists.
  // for (2), look at all existing "origin" keys in the memo, and for each one, if and only if the final number in the "origin" subsequence is less than num, you are permitted to concatenate
  // num to the end of the subsequence - calculate the newTotal (and update highestSoFar if newTotal breaks the record), and set the new subsequence at the new key if no subsequence already
  // exists there. (note that in both cases, the memo is only updated if no entry already exists - this is necessary because there is a chance that in calculating newTotal you could reach an
  // existing key which can already be reached without num, so if you replace it with a subsequence ending in num, you eliminate the chance of adding num to the end of the new subsequence.)

  // and grab whichever total is highest, such that that number is still less than the current number. this is now a possibility. however, the other possibility is that you should simply begin and end
  // with the current number (because, for example, the prior highest total is negative). whichever case is better, save that to a memo array. additionally, if it was determined that the best result
  // involves tacking on to an earlier subsequence, have a second memo array to track previous indices (such that the number in the array is the index value of the previous number to tack on to, or
  // is null if the number at that position is the first in the subsequence). after iterating through the entire array, it should be clear what the highest possible sum is. moreover, based on the array of
